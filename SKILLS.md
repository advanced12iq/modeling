## Repository rule
- Store all files for a specific lab inside that lab folder (for example: `lab1/`, `lab2/`).
- If work starts for a new lab and its folder is missing, create that new lab folder first.
- Keep shared `emblem.png` in repository root.
- Keep generated code results (`.png`, `.csv`, etc.) in `labN/`; copy to `labN/report/` only if report assets require it.
- Keep `explanation.md` and `simple.md` in `labN/`.
- Keep `labN/report/` for `report.*` files and assets referenced by `report.tex`.

- report-writing: Generate a full Russian-language laboratory report in LaTeX using a strict reusable template with fixed section structure, title page with `emblem.png`, and mandatory insertion of generated plots into the `Результаты` section. (file: skills/report-writing/SKILL.md)
